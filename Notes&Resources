- To change/fix the legacy locator[data-test='sing-in] to: getByTestId('sign-in'), need to add the (testIdAttribute: "data-test") to playwright.confi.js.use:

Assertions:

1. Locator Assertions: it automatically retries untill either passes or reaches timeout. Ex: await expect(locator).toBeVisible()

2. Value assertion will be evaluated one time and either pass or fail! EX:

test.only: will execute this test only
test.skip: will skip this test only

Strict mode violation: when more than one element found. ex: getByAltText("profile picture").first().click() first() will get the first element

setViewPortSize({width:0000,height:0000}) to change the browser size.

Screenshot, video, and trace can be turned on in config under use:.
