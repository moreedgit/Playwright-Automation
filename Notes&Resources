Open source tool built by Microsoft that enables reliable end to end UI and API automation test for moden web apps.

Highlights: 1. Built-in test runner 2. Ability to run tests in parallel with the ability to enable retries 3. Usefull built in reports with screenshots, videos, and trace viewer 4. VS code extention to help in building and maintainig your tests 5. Cross browser testing is built in out of the box 6. Multiple browsers and their drivers are

By installing Node.js you automatically get npm package manager

Npm playwright -v = shows the version of the installed playwright

npm install -D @playwright/test@latest = to update playwright, use this command in vscode terminal

Test Run Commands:
npx playwright test = runs all tests in headless
npx playwright test (testName to specify a test) —headed = runs all tests headed

npx playwright test --project=chromium --headed

npx playwright test (testName) --headed --debug = for debug mode

--grep: for taging and grouping
-npx playwright test -grep @smoke: for taged ones only
-npx playwright test -grep-invert @first: for all the other tests except for the tagged one

Not: to change the test run commands in CLI, updat the Pachage.json."scripts":

1. npm run test
2. npm run test:chromium

Codegen:
npx playwright codegen = to start the code gen tool
CTRL C = to end the codegen

- To change/fix the legacy locator[data-test='sing-in] to: getByTestId('sign-in'), need to add the (testIdAttribute: "data-test") to playwright.confi.js.use:

Assertions:

1. Locator Assertions: it automatically retries untill either passes or reaches timeout. Ex: await expect(locator).toBeVisible()

2. Value assertion will be evaluated one time and either pass or fail! EX:

Auto-retrying assertions​
The following assertions will retry until the assertion passes, or the assertion timeout is reached. Note that retrying assertions are async, so you must await them.EX: await expect(locator).toHaveText(), Element matches text

Non-retrying assertions​
These assertions allow to test any conditions, but do not auto-retry. Most of the time, web pages show information asynchronously, and using non-retrying assertions can lead to a flaky test.
Prefer auto-retrying assertions whenever possible. For more complex assertions that need to be retried, use expect.poll or expect.toPass. EX: expect(value).toContain() String contains a substring

test.only: will execute this test only
test.skip: will skip this test only

Strict mode violation: when more than one element found. ex: getByAltText("profile picture").first().click() first() will get the first element

setViewPortSize({width:0000,height:0000}) to change the browser size.

Screenshot, video, and trace can be turned on in config under use:

Test Annotations:
test.describe("group name"): for grouping the test
Some usefull methods: test.skip, test.only,
test.fail(): will fail the test for documentation purposes
test.slow(): will give triple or more time for for the test to run, specialy for the failing part
